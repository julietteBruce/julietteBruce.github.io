    We study the Betti tables of reducible algebraic curves with a focus on connected line arrangements and provide a general formula for computing the quadratic strand of the Betti table for line arrangements that satisfy certain hypotheses. We also give explicit formulas for the entries of the Betti tables for all curves of genus zero and one. Last, we give formulas for the graded Betti numbers for a class of curves of higher genus.
