This paper provides a rigorous study of tropicalizations of locally symmetric varieties.
We give applications beyond tropical geometry, to the cohomology of moduli spaces as well as to
the cohomology of arithmetic groups. We study two cases in detail: the case of level structures on
the moduli space \(\mathcal{A}_}g}\) of abelian varieties, and the special unitary case.
