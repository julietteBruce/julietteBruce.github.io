We study the asymptotic non-vanishing of syzygies for products of
projective spaces. Generalizing the monomial methods of Ein, Erman, and
Lazarsfeld \cite{einErmanLazarsfeld16} we give an explicit range in
which the graded Betti numbers of \(\mathbb{P}^{n_1}\times \mathbb{P}^{n_2}\) embedded by
\(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^{n_1}\times\mathbb{P}^{n_2}}(d_1,d_2)\) are non-zero. These bounds
provide the first example of how the asymptotic syzygies of a smooth
projective variety whose embedding line bundle grows in a semi-ample
fashion behave in nuanced and previously unseen ways.
