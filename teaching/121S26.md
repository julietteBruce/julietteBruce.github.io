## Class Policies

#### Course Expectations:
I believe in the axioms laid out by SFSU Professor Federico Ardila Links to an external site., and I will use them to guide my instruction of this course.

1. Mathematical potential is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.

2. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.

3. Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.

4. Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.

Using these as guiding principles, I expect students in Math 8 to collaborate with me in developing and maintaining an inclusive learning environment where diversity and individual differences are understood, respected, and recognized as a source of strength. Racism, discrimination, harassment, and bullying will not be tolerated. I expect all participants in this course (students and faculty alike) to treat each other with courtesy and respect.

Mathematics requires active participation. Before each class period, please read the assigned sections.  Arrive to class ready to share what you have learned and also what remains confusing.  Class meetings will involve some interactive lecture and other activities in a variety of formats; you will get the most out of each class day if you arrive ready to engage. In all settings, collaborate thoughtfully and ask questions respectfully: everyone should be able to freely participate.

#### Honor Principle
We will strictly enforce Dartmouth's Academic Honor Principle. 

## Additional Information

#### Course Catalogue Description:
This course is a sequel to MATH 3 and is appropriate for students who have successfully completed an AB calculus curriculum (or the equivalent) in secondary school. Roughly half of the course is devoted to topics in one-variable calculus, selected from techniques of integrations, areas, volumes, numerical integration, sequences and series including Taylor series, ordinary differential equations and techniques of their solution. The second half of the course studies scalar valued functions of several variables. It begins with the study of vector geometry, equations of lines and planes, and space curves (velocity, acceleration, arclength). The balance of the course is devoted to studying differential calculus of functions of several variables. Topics include limits and continuity, partial derivatives, tangent planes and differentials, the Chain Rule, directional derivatives and applications, and optimization problems including the use of Lagrange multipliers.

#### Mental Health:
The academic environment at Dartmouth is challenging, our terms are intensive, and classes are not the only demanding part of your life. There are a number of resources available to you on campus to support your wellness:

- [Undergraduate Dean](https://students.dartmouth.edu/undergraduate-deans/);
- [The Counseling Center](https://students.dartmouth.edu/health-service/counseling/about); and the 
- [Student Wellness Center](https://students.dartmouth.edu/wellness-center/. 

I encourage you to use these resources to take care of yourself throughout the term. Please come speak to me if you experience any difficulties, or would like help accessing any of these recourses.

#### Student Accessibility Services:
Students requesting disability-related accommodations and services for this course are encouraged to schedule a phone/video meeting with me as early in the term as possible. This conversation will help to establish what supports are built into my online course. In order for accommodations to be authorized, students are required to consult with Student Accessibility Services (SAS; student.accessibility.services@dartmouth.edu; 603-646-9900) and to email me their SAS accommodation form. We will then work together with SAS if accommodations need to be modified based on the online learning environment. If students have questions about whether they are eligible for accommodations, they should contact the SAS office. All inquiries and discussions will remain confidential.


#### Title IX:
At Dartmouth, we value integrity, responsibility, and respect for the rights and interests of others, all central to our Principles of Community. We are dedicated to establishing and maintaining a safe and inclusive campus where all have equal access to the educational and employment opportunities Dartmouth offers. We strive to promote an environment of sexual respect, safety, and well-being. In its policies and standards, Dartmouth demonstrates unequivocally that sexual assault, gender-based harassment, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking are not tolerated in our community. 

The [Sexual Respect Website]https://sexual-respect.dartmouth.edu) at Dartmouth provides a wealth of information on your rights with regard to sexual respect and resources that are available to all in our community. 

Please note that, as a faculty member, I am obligated to share disclosures regarding conduct under Title IX with Dartmouth's Title IX Coordinator. Confidential resources are also available, and include licensed medical or counseling professionals (e.g., a licensed psychologist), staff members of organizations recognized as rape crisis centers under state law (such as WISE), and ordained clergy (see https://eoatix.dartmouth.edu).

Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact Dartmouth's Title IX Coordinator or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator for the Guarini School. Their contact information can be found on the sexual respect website at: https://sexual-respect.dartmouth.edu.


#### Religous Observances:
Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that occur during this academic term. If you have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in the course, please meet with me as soon as possible, or before the end of the second week of the term (at the latest) to discuss appropriate adjustments. Dartmouth has a deep commitment to support students’ religious observances and diverse faith practices.


#### Additional Support:
Cooperation on weekly homework is permitted (and encouraged), but you should write up the solution on your own.  In other words, share your thoughts (say on a blackboard) to get started, but write up the solution afterwards using only your understanding.  Please acknowledge any cooperative work at the end of each assignment.

Plagiarism, collusion, or other violations of the Academic Honor Principle will be referred to the The Committee on Standards.  If you have any questions as to whether some action would be acceptable under the Academic Honor Principle, please speak to me beforehand. For more information about standards of conduct, please see these resources.
