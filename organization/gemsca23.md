## Meeting Structure
While reading, write any questions you have and bring them. Each week the speaker will be giving a ~15 minute talk summarizing the reading that week (maybe bullet-point style), skipping proofs and focusing on how to use the theorems and objects. Note that being the speaker does *not* mean you are expected to know everything -- You can have lots of questions too. After, we can all discuss questions we had on the reading.
