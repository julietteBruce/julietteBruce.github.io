![GOS](/images/organization/umn.jpg "UMN Math Building")

## About
A workshop for graduate students at the University of Minnesota, November 10-12, 2023 focused on forming a community for women and non-binary researchers interested in commutative algebra through learning about specific topics in commutative algebra from a diverse group of prominent active researchers. The goals of this workshop are to
1. introduce participants to cutting edge research topics in commutative algebra and surrounding areas,
2. facilitate the formation of mentoring relationships between participants and faculty,
3. strengthen the network of women and non-binary mathematicians in commutative
algebra and surrounding areas, and
4. develop long-term collaborative relationships.

## Meeting Structure
While reading, write any questions you have and bring them. Each week the speaker will be giving a ~15 minute talk summarizing the reading that week (maybe bullet-point style), skipping proofs and focusing on how to use the theorems and objects. Note that being the speaker does *not* mean you are expected to know everything -- You can have lots of questions too. After, we can all discuss questions we had on the reading.
